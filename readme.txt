This is a demo project accompanying the blog post:
https://www.luminis.eu/blog/development-en/building-resilient-connections-using-a-circuit-breaker/

The goal for the project is to experiment with the Resilience4j library. See how we can use the circuit breaker implementation.

The project contains two main files, one to start the dummy rest server (a spring project) and
another to start the client with the circuit breaker.
